#Truths vindication of election, and reprobation Wherein is shewed, Christ the cause of election; sin the cause of reprobation. The iustice of God is likewise cleared from that which is layd upon him by many; (namely) that some shall one day be damned for unbelief, and yet he never gave a Christ for them to beleeve in. Most of the strongest objections that scriptures or reason can make, answered. By William Fouler minister of the gospel at Ingworth in Norffolk.#

1. Truths Vindication OF Election, and Reprobation.

    _ Queſt. Did Chriſt redeem all thoſe that were laſt in Adam?

    _ Queſt.

    _ Queſt.

    _ Object.

    _ Queſt. But if this be ſo, then all children that die in their infancy are ſaved?

    _ Queſt.

    _ Queſt. I deſire you would make it clearer, that Chriſt dyed for all, ſurely the ſcripture is very dark for that purpoſe?

    _ Queſt. But there are many Objections againſt it in Scripture?

    _ Object, 1.

    _ Object. 3. But if Chriſt dyed for all, why are not all ſaved?

    _ Object. 4. It is ſaid Rom. 5. 9. That many are made righteous; and in John 10. I lay down my life for my ſheep.

    _ Object. 5. Surely Chriſt would not dye for thoſe he would not pray for; but Chriſt would not pray for the World, 17 John 9.

    _ Object. 6. If Chriſt died for all, then men muſt have free will to take and refuſe good and evill as they pleaſe.

    _ Object. But ſurely it connot be that Chriſt ſhould die for all; Did he die for Judas?

    _ Object. 8. But Judas was a Devil, and ſurely the Pſalms ſaith of him, that he ſhould betray Chriſt, as he did; would Chriſt die for a Traytor?

    _ Object. 9. But was he not ordained of God, that he ſhould betray his Maſter Chriſt?

    _ Object. 10. But it is ſaid, whom God loveth, be loveth to the end.

    _ Object. 11. If Ʋniverſall Redemption be granted, it will overthrow Election and Reprobation.

    _ Object.

    _ 12 Object. Then (it ſeems) you hold, that there is no Reprobation.

    _ 13 Object.

    _ 14. Obj. Hath not the Potter power over the clay to make one veſſell to honour, and another to diſhonour? as ſaith the Apoſtle Romans 9. verſe 21.

    _ 15. Ob. But none can come to Chriſt except God draweth him. John 6. 44.

    _ Object. 16.

    _ Object. 17.

    _ Object. 18.

    _ Object. 19.

    _ Object. 20.

    _ Ob. 21. Doth God give all power alike?

    _ Ob. 22. Surely Chriſt dyed for ſome, but onely for a temporall being.

    _ Ob. 23. Surely it muſt needs be if Chriſt dyed for all men, then all muſt have free will?

    _ Ob. 24.

    _ Ob. If Chriſt hath taken away the guilt of Adams ſin from all, then, what ſhall any hee damned for?

    _ Ob. 25. Unbelief cannot be the condemning ſin only, for it is ſaid in the firſt of the Cor. 6, 4. Know ye not that the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdome of God, neither Fornicators, nor Idolaters, nor Adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abuſers of themſelves with mankind, nor Thieves, nor Drunkards, nor Revilers, nor Extortioners ſhall inherit the Kingdom of God? compared with Eph. 5. v. 5, 6. Let no man deceive you with vain words, for becauſe of theſe things commeth the wrath of God upon the children of diſobedience. From theſe you ſee that condemnation is inflicted for theſe as well as unbelief.
